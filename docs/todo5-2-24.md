Testing and Validation:

    Unit Tests: Write comprehensive unit tests for each function, especially for critical parts like validate_and_process_event, fetch_and_process_events_from_queue, and create_inclusion_transaction.
    Integration Tests: Develop integration tests to ensure the off-chain worker, event synchronization, and RPC endpoints work together seamlessly.
    Mock Testing: Use mocking techniques to simulate external data sources and RPC calls.

Integration with Priority Queue:

    Extend Functionality: Fully integrate the priority queue functionality, ensuring that the events are properly prioritized and processed according to the queue.
    RPC Enhancements: Improve the RPC methods to handle more complex queries and updates to the priority queue.

Key-Value Store Implementation:

    KV Store Integration: Implement and integrate a key-value store to persist cross-chain events, ensuring data consistency and availability.
    Garbage Collection: Add logic for garbage collection to clean up the KV store once events are included in the blockchain.

Enhanced Leader Election Logic:

    Robust Leader Election: Refine the leader election logic to handle more complex scenarios and improve robustness.
    Leader Rotation: Implement and test leader rotation mechanisms to ensure fair and efficient distribution of leadership tasks.

Optimization and Performance Tuning:

    Performance Testing: Conduct performance tests to identify and address any bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the off-chain worker and event processing logic.
    Optimization: Optimize the codebase for better performance and lower latency in event processing.
